<h1>Algorithms and Data Structures Enhancement</h1>

<h2>Artifact Overview</h2>

<p>
The selected artifact for this category was originally developed in CS-300
(Data Structures and Algorithms). The project implemented a Binary Search Tree (BST)
to store and retrieve structured data efficiently.
</p>

<p>
The original implementation successfully inserted, searched, and displayed
data using BST logic. However, additional analysis and refinement were applied
to strengthen algorithmic reasoning and evaluation.
</p>

<h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Expanded documentation explaining algorithm logic</li>
  <li>Analyzed time complexity for insertion and search operations</li>
  <li>Discussed trade-offs between different data structure choices</li>
  <li>Improved readability and structural clarity of code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Algorithmic Evaluation</h2>

<p>
The Binary Search Tree provides average-case time complexity of
<strong>O(log n)</strong> for insertion and search operations when balanced.
However, in worst-case scenarios where the tree becomes unbalanced,
performance degrades to <strong>O(n)</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Alternative data structures such as vectors or unsorted lists would require
linear search with <strong>O(n)</strong> time complexity for lookups.
Therefore, the BST was selected to improve efficiency as dataset size increases.
</p>

<p>
This evaluation demonstrates understanding of computational trade-offs,
scalability considerations, and structured algorithm design.
</p>

<h2>Design Trade-Offs</h2>

<p>
While the BST improves average-case efficiency, it introduces potential
imbalance risks without self-balancing mechanisms such as AVL or Red-Black Trees.
The chosen design reflects a balance between conceptual clarity and performance
appropriate for the scope of the original assignment.
</p>

<h2>Alignment to Course Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles</li>
  <li>Analyze efficiency and time complexity</li>
  <li>Articulate structured approaches to solving logic problems</li>
  <li>Communicate technical trade-offs clearly and professionally</li>
</ul>

<h2>Original and Enhanced Artifacts</h2>

<p>
Original and enhanced versions of the BST implementation are included
in the project repository as part of the final submission.
