<h1>Database Enhancement</h1>

<h2>Artifact Overview</h2>

<p>
The selected artifact for this category involved implementing and enhancing
database functionality through structured Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD)
operations. The original implementation demonstrated basic data interaction
but provided opportunities for refinement in schema clarity, validation,
and structured data management.
</p>

<h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Refined schema structure for improved clarity and logical organization</li>
  <li>Expanded CRUD operations to ensure full lifecycle data management</li>
  <li>Improved validation before database operations</li>
  <li>Strengthened error handling and data integrity controls</li>
  <li>Improved documentation of data flow and database interactions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Schema and Data Design</h2>

<p>
The database schema was organized to ensure logical separation of entities
and enforce data consistency. Field constraints and structured access patterns
were emphasized to prevent malformed or incomplete data from entering the system.
</p>

<p>
Clear relationships between data elements were maintained to support
accurate retrieval and maintain long-term scalability.
</p>

<h2>Security and Data Integrity</h2>

<p>
A security mindset was applied by enforcing explicit validation prior to
database insertion or update operations. Input data is checked to ensure
it meets defined constraints, reducing the risk of corrupted or inconsistent records.
</p>

<p>
By incorporating validation and defensive data handling, the system anticipates
potential misuse and mitigates vulnerabilities that could arise from improper input.
This reflects best practices in secure database design and implementation.
</p>

<h2>Alignment to Course Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Develop computing solutions that manage structured data effectively</li>
  <li>Apply database design principles and structured CRUD operations</li>
  <li>Demonstrate professional documentation and communication of system design</li>
  <li>Develop a security mindset through explicit validation and data protection</li>
</ul>
