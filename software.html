<h1>Software Design and Engineering Enhancement</h1>

<h2>Artifact Overview</h2>

<p>
The selected artifact for this category was originally developed in CS-320
(Software Testing, Automation, and Quality Assurance). It consisted of
object-oriented classes representing application entities and associated services
responsible for managing those objects.
</p>

<p>
The original implementation met functional requirements but presented
opportunities for structural improvement, enhanced validation logic,
and clearer separation of responsibilities.
</p>

<h2>Enhancements Implemented</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Strengthened input validation to prevent invalid object states</li>
  <li>Improved encapsulation by limiting direct access to class fields</li>
  <li>Refactored logic to improve clarity and maintainability</li>
  <li>Enhanced documentation for readability and professional presentation</li>
  <li>Applied iterative testing to verify functionality after modifications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Design Improvements</h2>

<p>
The refactoring process focused on reinforcing object-oriented principles
such as encapsulation, separation of concerns, and controlled state mutation.
By centralizing validation logic within constructors and update methods,
the design prevents invalid data from entering the system.
</p>

<p>
These improvements reflect industry-standard development practices where
maintainability, clarity, and defensive programming are prioritized.
</p>

<h2>Security and Validation Considerations</h2>

<p>
A security mindset was incorporated by enforcing explicit validation rules.
Input values are checked before being stored, preventing malformed or
inconsistent data from compromising system integrity.
</p>

<p>
This approach demonstrates awareness of adversarial or unintended misuse
and aligns with best practices in secure software development.
</p>

<h2>Alignment to Course Outcomes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Design and evaluate computing solutions using structured software engineering practices</li>
  <li>Apply iterative testing and refactoring techniques</li>
  <li>Communicate design decisions clearly and professionally</li>
  <li>Develop a security-aware approach through defensive programming</li>
</ul>

<h2>Original and Enhanced Artifacts</h2>

<p>
Original artifact and enhanced version are included in the project repository
as part of the final submission.
