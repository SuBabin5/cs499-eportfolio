<h1>Informal Code Review</h1>

<h2>Purpose of the Review</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this informal code review was to analyze previously developed artifacts,
identify areas for structural and logical improvement, and outline enhancement plans
aligned with the three major areas of computer science: software design and engineering,
algorithms and data structures, and databases.
</p>

<h2>Existing Functionality</h2>

<p>
The original artifacts successfully met their academic requirements. They included
object-oriented class structures, a Binary Search Tree implementation for efficient
data retrieval, and structured database CRUD functionality. While functional,
opportunities existed to improve validation, structure, efficiency analysis,
documentation, and security considerations.
</p>

<h2>Code Analysis</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Strengthening input validation to prevent invalid states</li>
  <li>Improving encapsulation and separation of responsibilities</li>
  <li>Evaluating algorithmic efficiency and explaining time complexity</li>
  <li>Clarifying database schema design and data flow</li>
  <li>Improving documentation and readability for maintainability</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enhancement Strategy</h2>

<p>
Enhancements were implemented across three categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Software Design and Engineering:</strong> Refactoring class structure, enforcing validation rules,
  and improving adherence to object-oriented principles.</li>

  <li><strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong> Analyzing and justifying the use of a Binary Search Tree,
  discussing time complexity, and considering design trade-offs.</li>

  <li><strong>Databases:</strong> Expanding CRUD operations, refining schema clarity, and strengthening input validation
  to preserve data integrity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Alignment to Course Outcomes</h2>

<p>
This review demonstrates collaboration and professional communication by clearly identifying
design weaknesses and improvement strategies. It supports decision making in computing environments,
applies algorithmic reasoning, incorporates software engineering best practices,
and reflects a security mindset through structured validation and defensive programming.
</p>

<h2>Code Review Video</h2>

<p>
The informal code review video is included as part of the final project submission.
It provides a walkthrough of the original artifacts, identified weaknesses,
and the enhancement plan implemented throughout this capstone.
