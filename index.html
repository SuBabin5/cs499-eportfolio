<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

<p>
My name is Babin Sunar, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
Throughout this program, I have strengthened my skills in software design, algorithms, database systems, testing,
and professional communication. This portfolio demonstrates not only the artifacts I created during the program,
but also the enhancements I implemented to reflect growth, refinement, and deeper technical understanding.
</p>

<p>
Through my coursework, I developed the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles
while managing trade-offs in efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. In my algorithms enhancement, I implemented
a Binary Search Tree and analyzed its time complexity, demonstrating structured problem solving and computational reasoning.
</p>

<p>
In the software design and engineering enhancement, I improved validation logic, strengthened encapsulation,
and refined object-oriented structure. This process reflected real-world development practices such as iterative improvement,
refactoring, and applying the software development lifecycle.
</p>

<p>
For the database enhancement, I implemented structured CRUD operations, clarified schema design,
and incorporated stronger input validation to maintain data integrity. This work reflects a security mindset
by ensuring explicit validation and protection of system data.
</p>

<p>
The code review process further strengthened my ability to communicate technical decisions clearly and professionally.
By identifying areas for improvement and explaining enhancement strategies, I demonstrated collaboration
and decision-making practices expected in professional computing environments.
</p>

<p>
The artifacts included in this ePortfolio represent growth across three core areas of computer science:
Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.
Together, they showcase my readiness to contribute professionally in the field of computer science.
