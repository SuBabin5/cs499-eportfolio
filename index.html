<h1>Professional Self-Assessment</h1>

<p>
My name is Babin Sunar, and this ePortfolio represents the culmination of my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.
Throughout this program, I have strengthened my skills in software design, algorithms, database systems, testing,
and professional technical communication. This portfolio demonstrates both the original artifacts I developed
and the enhancements I implemented to reflect growth, refinement, and deeper technical understanding.
</p>

<h2>Growth Throughout the Program</h2>

<p>
Across my coursework, I developed the ability to design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles
while managing trade-offs in efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. In my algorithms enhancement, I implemented
and analyzed a Binary Search Tree, demonstrating understanding of time complexity, structured problem solving,
and data organization strategies.
</p>

<p>
In the software design and engineering enhancement, I strengthened validation logic, improved encapsulation,
and refined object-oriented structure. Through this process, I applied software development lifecycle principles,
iterative testing, and refactoring techniques that mirror professional development practices.
</p>

<p>
For the database enhancement, I expanded CRUD functionality, clarified schema design, and incorporated stronger
input validation to protect data integrity. This reflects a security mindset by ensuring that data is explicitly
validated and system integrity is preserved.
</p>

<h2>Collaboration and Communication</h2>

<p>
The informal code review process strengthened my ability to communicate technical decisions clearly and professionally.
By analyzing existing functionality, identifying areas for improvement, and justifying enhancement strategies,
I demonstrated collaboration and support for organizational decision making in computing environments.
</p>

<h2>Integration of Skills</h2>

<p>
The artifacts that follow represent growth across three core areas of computer science:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Software Design and Engineering</li>
  <li>Algorithms and Data Structures</li>
  <li>Databases</li>
</ul>

<p>
Together, these artifacts showcase my readiness to contribute professionally in the field of computer science,
demonstrating technical competency, structured problem solving, professional communication, and a security-aware mindset.
